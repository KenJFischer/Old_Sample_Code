# Sample_Code
 A collection of some pieces of code from my projects.

The .vb files here are from a financial account balance tracking utility I wrote. The user could enter transactions for multiple different accounts, view all transactions and a summary of the account data, and submit transfers between accounts.

The .cs file here is from a job-organizing software I wrote. It allowed the user to organize large projects into tasks and to break down those tasks into individual steps. It could also store information related to each task and had a system for the user to leave reminders or take notes.

Both these projects were essentially exercises in file-reading and data parsing, written several years ago. My coding style has shifted quite a bit since then, but I still find it interesting to look back at how I used to approach these sorts of problems.
